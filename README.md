# odin-recipes   
This is the first project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.   
The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).   
   
The webpages created are [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/odin-recipes/).   
   
In this project, only HTML files were created, so the pages created are very rudimentary at this stage.   
At the same time, however, I have tried to implement the best practice for writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).   
   
In the near future, I will add more style to the pages with CSS.
